    <p class="rainbow">everyone knows Mario is cool as fuck but who knows what he's thinking<br>
      who knows why he crushes turtles<br>
      and why do we think about him as fondly as we think of the mythical (nonexistent?) Dr Pepper<br>
      perchance<br>
      I believe it was Kant who said "Experience without theory is blind, but theory without experience is mere intellectual play."<br>
      Mario exhibits experience by crushing turts all day, but he exhibits theory by stating "Lets-a gol Keep it up, baby!"<br>
      when Mario leaves his place of safety to stomp a turty, he knows that he may die<br>
      and yet, for a man who can purchase lives with money, a life becomes a mere store of value<br>
      a tax that can be paid for, much as a rich man feels any law with a fine is a price<br>
      we think of Mario as a hero, but he is simply a one percenter of a more privileged variety<br>
      the lifekind, perchance
